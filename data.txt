Activity 4: Newton’s Method for Finding Optimal Smartphone Battery Decay Rate

A. Objectives
Implement Newton’s Method accurately.
Analyze battery decay modeled by exponential function.
Evaluate roots where the function hits critical failure points.

B. Pre-Laboratory Preparation
Prepare real scenario:
Battery decay function:
f(t)=e^(-0.3t)-0.5
Goal: Solve for the time t when battery reaches 50%.
Derivative:
f'(t)=-0.3e^(-0.3t)
