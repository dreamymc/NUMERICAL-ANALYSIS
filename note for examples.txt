Device	How it changes input / interpretation
Smartphone	Battery reaches 50% quickly (~2–3 hours). So you’d pick t0 around 2 or 3.
Smartwatch	Battery drains slower (~24–48 hours). Pick t0 around 5
IoT sensor	Battery drains very slowly (~weeks). Pick t0 higher 10




Examples of tolerance values
Tolerance       Meaning     Accuracy Level
1e-2             0.01	    2 decimal places
1e-3	         0.001	    3 decimal places
1e-4	         0.0001	      very accurate
1e-5	         0.00001	 very very accurate
1e-6	         0.000001	extremely accurate (overkill for labs)
